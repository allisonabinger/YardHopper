# Dev 

This folder contains the technical development for the Full Stack development of YardHopper. There are two folders inside of here: Front-End and Back-End. These will be used for subteams to work within their spaces but also allow the other sub teams to access once they have pushed to Front-End.

<!-- This branch will be the highest branch that we work on for development. This will be the stopping point for both back-end, front-end, and non-technical contributions until a confirmation of full function is complete. This branch will NOT be merged to main very often, but will receive merges from BackEnd and FrontEnd regularly. The Front and Back end teams should be working within their respective directories, and the BackEnd and FrontEnd branches should push no higher than the Dev (FullStack) folder. -->
